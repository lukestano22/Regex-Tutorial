# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email
A string of characters that specifies a search pattern in text is called a regular expression, or regex. These expressions are quite helpful for extracting information from text that follows a certain pattern, such as emails, phone numbers, and more. They are extensively utilized in a variety of programming languages, such as JavaScript.

## Summary
I'll break down the following regex for matching an email in this tutorial: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, dissecting it into its component elements. For validating email inputs in a variety of applications, this regex is useful.

## Anchors
The anchors $ and ^ are used by this regex to identify the beginning and end of a string, respectively. These markers indicate the start and finish of the full string rather than individual lines because multiline mode is not enabled.

## Quantifiers
This regex uses the quantifiers {x, y}, where x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of occurrences, and +, which denotes one or more occurrences. For example, the first + denotes one or more characters that satisfy [a-z0-9_\.-]. Similar to this, {2,6} designates between two and six characters in the set [a-z\.], and another + denotes one or more characters in the set [\da-z\.-].

## OR Operator
In this regex, the OR operator [] is employed. For instance, [a-z0-9_\.-] denotes any character (case insensitive) from a to z, as well as any numeral from 0 to 9, _,., or -. Instead of using the regex meaning of., which matches any character, the \ is utilized to denote a literal.

## Character Classes
The character class \d, which represents any digit from 0 to 9, is included in this regex. To distinguish it from a literal d, the \ signifies that it is a character class.

## Flags
There are / characters all around this regex without any flags. Since there is no multiline mode enabled (a m flag would appear after the final /), the anchors match the start and stop of the string instead of the start and end of each line.

## Grouping and Capturing
In this regex, the parentheses () are utilized to group and capture. The email address's username is captured in the first set, the domain name is captured in the second set, and the top-level domain is captured in the third set. /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.] in summary[2,6}]A literal @ is followed by one or more characters \d, a-z (case insensitive),., or -, followed by a literal., and finally, two to six characters a-z (case insensitive) or. $/ matches one or more characters a-z (case insensitive), 0-9, _,., or -.
